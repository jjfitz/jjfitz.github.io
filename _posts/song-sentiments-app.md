<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This might sound strange, but I think it is fascinating to look at the words we say and why we choose them. I think that the words we say/hear have an effect on us. I started to become curious at the different songs I was listening to, and I started to think of doing some basic sentiment analysis on them. As I started to look more into it, I decided that I would build a shiny app so that people could see a quick sentiment analysis of what they listen to. In the future I am hoping to build it out so that you can do it on albums, artists, and export the lyrics, but for now it is just the songs.</p>
<p>Here is a link to access the shiny app to look at your favorite songs:</p>

<div id="getting-the-lyrics" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting the Lyrics</h2>
<p>After I built the app, I have been finding that there are R packages out there that already pull song lyrics, like geniusR. I might use those in the future for albums and artists. I pull the lyrics by scrapping the azlyrics.com website. Their Urls are structered by putting in the artist and the song name, and poof, you can get the lyrics.</p>
</div>
<div id="doing-the-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Doing the Analysis</h2>
<p>To do the analysis, I use a little bit of all the different sentiment libraries. I use the bing sentiments to get whether or not a word is negative or positive, afinn to get how negative or positive a word is, and nrc to look at the basic adjective that a word could belong too. The words in the nrc dataset does have words that have multiple adjectives associated with them, so keep that in mind. I pretty much count up all the words, and then make graphs out of them.</p>
